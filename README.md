# Open Unity Merge Tool
This tool helps you solve merge conflicts in Unity scenes and prefabs.
It's a spiritual successor to [GitMerge for Unity](https://flashg.github.io/GitMerge-for-Unity/) by the same developer.

It's currently around 90% ready, but needs some finishing touches.

# Repositories

There is a mirror on [GitHub](https://github.com/FlaShG/Open-Unity-Merge-Tool) for convenience reasons.
